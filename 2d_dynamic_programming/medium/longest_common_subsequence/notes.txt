We create a 2 dimensional grid with
out-of-bound values initialized to 0.
The rows, denoted by i, will rep-
resent the ith character of 
text1 and the column, denoted
by j, will represent the jth
character of text2.

We iterate in reverse starting
from the last row, last column.

If the characters at the current
i and j match indices each other, 
we look at the value to its dia-
gonal and add 1 to it.

If the characters at the current
i and j indices match each other,
we take the max between the value
direct below it and directly to
the right of it.

We repeat until we reach i = 0
and j = 0 (top left of the grid).

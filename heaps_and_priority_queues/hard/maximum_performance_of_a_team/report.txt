Step 1: Sort zipped efficiency and speed engineer list by
efficiency in descending order.

Step 2: Initialize a Min Heap that will store the speeds
of employees we iterate over and a result variable intended
for the return value corresponding to the max performance.
Also, initialize a speed variable which will be the running
count of speed

Step 3: Iterate through the sorted engineers list. At each
iteration, increment the running speed variable by speed
extracted from the current iteration of engineers.
L> If the length of the Min Heap is equal to k, then we pop
from the Heap the minimum speed, and subtract that speed with
the running speed to make sure we are forming a team with 
at most k engineers.

Step 4: Push the updated running speed to the Min Heap

Step 5: Calculate the performance by multiplying the 
current efficiency with the running speed.
L> If this calculation is greater than the current result,
update the result variable to reflect this new maxiumum 
performance value.

Step 6: Mod the result with (10 ** 9 + 7) and return it

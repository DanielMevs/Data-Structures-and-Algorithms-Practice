First, we define a max heap called Small Heap and
a min heap called Large Heap.

By default, we can just add elements to the
Small Heap until the length difference exceeds 1.

We compare the max of the Small Heap and the min
of the large heap. If the min of the Large Heap
is less than the max of the Small Heap, we remove
the max of the Small Heap and add it to the Large
Heap. We repeat to see if the lengths are 
approximately equal.

Looking up the max and min for the heaps is O(1)
and adding to and removing from a heap is O(logn)

Finding the median takes O(1) time because we're 
simply taking the max from the Small Heap, the 
min from the Large Heap, adding them togther and
dividing them by 2.

Two solve this problem, we can have a 
set and a target calculated by
taking half of the total sum of 
our input array.
We first iterate through this list of
integers backwards. 

nums = [ 1, 5, 11, 5 ]
target = 11

We can either include 5 in
our subarray or we don't.
=> we had 0 or 5 to our set.
As we iterate backwards, we 
take the current element of
our list and add it to every
element that's currently in
our set and add this result
to our set.
If we ever get a scenario where
one of the values in our set
is equal to target, we can
return true.

set = {0, 5, 11, 16, 10, 21, 
    1, 6, 12, 17, 22}

If we build this set and it 
does not contain our target,
we return false.

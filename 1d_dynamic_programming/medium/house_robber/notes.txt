- You are given an array of integers, 
nums, where the value nums[i] repre-
sents the amount of money you can 
steal fro the ith house.
- Constraint: if we rob adjacent
house the same night, a security
alarm will go off. 
- Return the maximum amount of 
money we can rob in 1 night w/out
alerting the police.

- When we compute the running max of
the money we could steal, we are asking
ourselves 2 questions (as we iterate
through the array):

1. Should we rob the current house and
add that to the running sum we calculated
two houses ago?

2. Should we not rob the current house
and take the running max at the prev-
iously visited house?

- We determine this by taking the opt-
ion that will give us the max value at
the current house.

- The value we can steal from house 1
will be called rob1 and the value we
can steal from house 2 will be rob2.

- We store the max option in a variable 
called temp.

- We assign rob1 equal to rob2 and
set rob2 every time to be equal to
temp.

- By the end of our iteration, temp
will have the max amount of money we
can rob given our constraint.

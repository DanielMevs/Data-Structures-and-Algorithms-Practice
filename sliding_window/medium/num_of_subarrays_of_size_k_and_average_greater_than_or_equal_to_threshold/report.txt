We iterate only the length of the  array minus k to offset the 
fact that we are starting off with the sum of the first
k elements minus 1. We add  one because the end range is
not inclusive. For example, if the length of the array is
6 and k is 3, 6 - 3 = 3; 3 + 1 = 4. 
If we initialze currentSum with the first 2 elements (k-1), 
then he are going to move the left pointer a maxiumum of 
4 - 1 = 3 times before adding an element to the kth spot
of the subarray starts giving us an index out of bounds error.

- Solution 1 time complexity: O(n + m + nlogn)
- Solution 2 time complexity: O(n + m + M) 

M: the maximum value in arr1
m: length of arr1
n: length of arr2

Solution 2 is more efficient if M is smaller relative to 
to n and m as it avoids sorting. However, if M is significantly
larger than n and m, Solution1 is more efficient.

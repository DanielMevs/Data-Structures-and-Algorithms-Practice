You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price 
of a given stock on the ith day.

For this problem, I first initialize the variable,
max_difference to keep track of the maximum 
profit. I also create a variable called 
buy_min, which equals to the minimum price I can
acquire this stock to give me the maximum profit.
I assign it the value of the first element in nums
because I intend to start my iteration at the second
element. If the first element in the iteration is less
than the minimum stock aquisition price, then I update
that pointer to that element, and handle each iteration 
accordingly. 

I also take the difference between the current price 
and the minimum aquisition price. If this difference is
greater than the maximum. After iterating to the end, the
resulting value for max_diff will equal the maximum 
profit.

When I first was trying to solve it, I focused on making my
solution fit the input given in the example, 
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] and thus misformulated my equation
to find the difference. To remedy the situation, I included
an else statement that skips checking the difference if 
the minimum price is less than the current price. Therefore,
the max_diff was never updated to reflect this erroneous price.
However, when the input was [1, 2], I soon realized the error
in my formula and refactored my code to the concluding 
solution.

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, 
remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element 
appears only once.

For this problem, I wanted to start by iterating over the 
array nums. The current number in the iteration was called num.
If I ran into a new digit, I would add it to 
a list of already seen nodes called unique_nums. However,
if num wasn't in the unique list, I would use .index to get 
the index of the first instance of that node and use it to 
pop it off of nums at that index. This measure ensures that
the resulting nums will contain only unique numbers and the
length of that array will equal the number of unique numbers
in nums.

Goal: maximize ((a * b) - (c * d))
where a, b, c, d are distinct elements
in the input array

Strategy: maximize (a * b) and
minimize (c * d) by finding the 2
maxium elements and the 2 minimum
elements
- To get these, we can just sort
the input array and get the elements
we need from the beggining and end of
the array
L> downside: O(nlogn) time

O(n) time O(n) space solution?
L> yes.
Create a Max Heap and a Min Heap
L> Heapify -> O(n)
L> Get max/min -> O(1)

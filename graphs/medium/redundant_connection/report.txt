Union Find

- We create an array of integers called
parents where parents[i] = the parent of
the ith node. Initially, it is set with
the node values themselves, denoting that
the ith node is a parent of itself.

- We also create an array called rank 
where rank[i] indicates how many
nodes considered that ith node to
be its parent. Initially, it is set
to all 1's.

- We go through the input array and if 
we find that a node is the parent of 
another secondary node, we change the
parent value at that secondary node's 
ith index to be the parent node's value.
We also increment the rank value at the 
ith index of the parent node.

- If we get to a case where we are given
two nodes (an edge) we find that they 
have the same parent (which can be found 
in the parent array), it means that they
are already connected and we can identify
and return that edge as our redundant edge.
